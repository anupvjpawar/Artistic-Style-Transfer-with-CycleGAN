# Artistic-Style-Transfer-with-CycleGAN
This project demonstrates how to apply artistic style transfer to images using a pre-trained CycleGAN model. The application allows users to upload an image and see it transformed in the style of famous artwork. The project uses Streamlit for the web interface and TensorFlow with TensorFlow Hub for the style transfer model.
